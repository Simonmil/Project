This is the great cheat sheet for the machine learning.

Dataset stuff


Dataset manipulation:

It is good practice to normalize features that use different scales and ranges.
One reason this is important is because the features are multiplied by the model weights. 
So, the scale of the outputs and the scale of the gradients are affected by the scale of the inputs.
Although a model might converge without feature normalization, normalization makes training much more stable.

Remember to transform Dataframes to np.array when extracting data

Models:

tf.keras.Sequential represents as sequence of steps Link: https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/sequential_model




Statitics:




Vizualization:

Remember to use plt.show() in programs where plotting is a thing. This sends the plot to x-server.



Numpy:

# Make NumPy printouts easier to read.
np.set_printoptions(precision=3, suppress=True)
